		<h2>With over 20 candidates so far, it can be pretty hard to even follow all of the candidates, let alone actually pick one. Here are some of the notable ones so far:</h2>
	</section>
	<div class="container">
		<section class="candidate">
			<img alt="Joe Biden" src="./resources/images/biden.jpg">
			<h3>Vice President Joe Biden</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Joe Biden served as a Senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2008. From 2009 to 2017, he served as Vice President to Barack Obama.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> So far, Biden is primarily campaigning to beat Trump. He has tried to appeal to the average blue-collar worker. However, he has also taken very strong stances on rebuilding international relationships and protecting our democracy at home.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> High. Biden is a very strong early frontrunner who has polled consistently well with the middle class.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="sanders">
			<img alt="Bernie Sanders" src="./resources/images/sanders.jpg">
			<h3>Senator Bernie Sanders</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Bernie Sanders has served in Congress for decades, with great experience in both the House and the Senate.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Sanders is one of the farthest left candidates on the ballot this year. He has consistently focused his campaign on a social safety net, redistributing wealth, affordable health care, and combating climate change.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Relativley high. Sanders is a close second to Biden, and has shown very strong polling and fundraising numbers.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="harris">
			<img alt="Kamala Harris" src="./resources/images/harris.jpg">
			<h3>Senator Kamala Harris</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Kamala Harris is currently a Senator. Before that, she served as the attorney general of California.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Harris has been an outspoken advocate for climate change reform, universal healthcare, LGBT rights, education reform and especially criminal justice reform.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Reasonable. She's been polling among the top Democrats, and has raised a signficant amount of money so far. However, she still trails Biden and Sanders.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="warren">
			<img alt="Elizabeth Warren" src="./resources/images/warren.jpg">
			<h3>Senator Elizabeth Warren</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Elizabeth Warren has served for years in the Senate. She has sponsored and passed numerous notable bills.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Warren is a supporter of the Green New Deal and similar climate change reform. She has also supported criminal justice reform, universal healthcare and has unveiled a very progressive education plan.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Reasonable. Warren started off poorly, but she has recently gained a surge of momentumthat has placed her solidly in third place behind Biden and Sanders.</p>
		</section>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<section class="candidate" id="buttigieg">
			<img alt="Pete Buttigieg" src="./resources/images/buttigieg.jpg">
			<h3>Mayor Pete Buttigieg</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Pete Buttigieg has some political experience, having served as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana for 8 years.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Buttigieg has expressed intent to reach voters in the midwest who voted Trump in 2016. He is also very pro-LGBT rights, especially given that he himself is gay. He also advocates for gun control and climate change reform.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Reasonable, but not high. While Buttigieg has had a spike in interest lately, it is unclear if that interest will remain.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="orourke">
			<img alt="Beto O'Rourke" src="./resources/images/orourke.jpg">
			<h3>Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Beto O'Rourke served in the House of Representatives for 8 years, and lost to incumbent Ted Cruz in his 2018 Senate bid.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> O'Rourke is a vocal advocate for immigration and climate change reform. Additionally, he also has supported gun control and universal healthcare.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Possible, but unlikely. While Beto had a very strong start, beating even Bernie in early funding, his campaign has greatly stalled lately.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="castro">
			<img alt="Julián Castro" src="./resources/images/castro.jpg">
			<h3>Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Julián Castro served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama. He also served as the Mayor of San Antonio, TX for 5 years.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Castro has advocated on numerous popular issues, including a "Medicare for all" program, education reform, and protecting LGBT rights.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Unlikely. Castro has not had the funding of Biden or Sanders, nor has he had the media precesence of Buttigieg or O'Rourke. It's still possible to turn his campaign around, but it'll be a tough road.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="candidate" id="klobuchar">
			<img alt="Amy Klobuchar" src="./resources/images/klobuchar.jpg">
			<h3>Senator Amy Klobuchar</h3>
			<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Amy Klobuchar has served in the Senate since 2007. Prior to her time in the Senate, she was an attorney.<br>
			<strong>Platform:</strong> Klobuchar has been outspoken about the costs of healthcare, though she doesn't lean as far left as others. She has also been outspoken in her efforts to ensure election security and protect agriculture and trade.<br>
			<strong>Chance to win?</strong> Unlikely. While she was <a class="outside" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/politics/democrats-2020-electability-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar-sherrod-brown/index.html">ranked as one of the most electable candidates by CNN</a>, she has since suffered from poor polling and fundraising efforts, and controversies over mistreatment of staff.</p>
