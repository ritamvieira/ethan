	<section class="about">
		<p>Hello! I'm Ethan, the creator of this website. I'm a high school student in a small town in a small state in the U.S. I made this site to talk about one of my favorite things to discuss: U.S. politics. I always had a remote interest in the subject, but it didn't become a big thing for me to read about and follow until this year. The reason that I ended up becoming so interested was that I ended up in a fantastic government class with a fantastic teacher. I had to follow politics because of that class, but it ended up being something that I followed not just because of school, but because it was genuinely something that I found very interesting. I focused in on the Democratic primary in particular for a few reasons. One is that it's a very big topic on the news right now. There are so many candidates that it's basically guaranteed that one of them will make the news at some point each day. I also focused in on the Democratic primary because it was a way for me to learn more about the candidates, so I could pick the ones that I wanted to support (At the moment, my favorites are <a href="info1.html#warren">Warren</a>, <a href="info1.html#buttigieg">Buttigieg</a>, and<a href="info1.html#harris">Harris</a>, in that order). The last reason that I picked the Democratic primary is because it was something that we had started to discuss in the government class I mentioned above, but I wasn't able to learn enough about it in the short time we discussed it in class for me to really understand the candidates.<br>

		Politics aren't the only thing in the world that I find interesting, though. I'm also an avid reader (at the moment, my favorite book is <em>Hold Still</em> by Nina LaCour), an avid gamer (my favorite game of all time is <em>Portal 2</em>), and a big musical theater fan (the best show that I've seen live was <em>The Book of Mormon</em>). I love spending time with my family and friends, and I honestly don't mind school as much as others do. All of these things have helped to shape who I am just as much as politics have, but politics are still my favorite thing to discuss with others. Thanks for taking the time to read this description about my boring self that was almost certainly way too long.</p>
